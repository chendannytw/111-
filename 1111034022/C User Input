//You have already learned that printf() is used to output values in C.
//To get user input, you can use the scanf() function:

---------------------------Ex1 down below---------------------------------

int main() {
  // Create an integer variable that will store the number we get from the user
  int myNum;

  // Ask the user to type a number
  printf("Type a number and press enter: \n"); 

  // Get and save the number the user types
  scanf("%d", &myNum);

  // Print the number the user typed
  printf("Your number is: %d", myNum);

  return 0;
}

//The scanf() function takes two arguments: 
//the format specifier of the variable (%d in the example above) and the reference operator (&myNum), which stores the memory address of the variable.
//Tip: You will learn more about memory addresses and functions in the next chapter.

//User Input Strings
//You can also get a string entered by the user:

---------------------------Ex1 down below---------------------------------

int main() {
  // Create a string
  char firstName[30];

  // Ask the user to input some text
  printf("Enter your first name: \n");

  // Get and save the text
  scanf("%s", firstName);

  // Output the text
  printf("Hello %s.", firstName);
  
  return 0;
}


//You must specify the size of the string/array 
//(we used a very high number, 30, but atleast then we are certain it will store enough characters for the first name), 
//and you don't have to specify the reference operator (&) when working with strings in scanf().
